Record linkage aka fuzzy matching is one of the common problems in many organisations. The problem is simple which organisations are integrating data from various sources which do not have a unique identifier to identify which record is duplicated to which. For example, customers required to use a different system with the same information but they made some mistakes like misspelling their name, leave blank or filling phone number instead of email etc.
