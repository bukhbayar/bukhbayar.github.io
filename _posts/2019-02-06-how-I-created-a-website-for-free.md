First of all, it is great to meet all of you since I closed my WordPress blog in 2011. Due to various issues, I had ended up with the decision to close it, but I am glad to meet you guys now with a fresh blog that hosted on GitHub pages and Heroku.
Before I dive into deep, I am starting with a post about how I created, and why It might be interesting to you.
