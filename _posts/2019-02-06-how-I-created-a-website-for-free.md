First of all, it's great to meet you all since I closed my WordPress blog in 2011. Due to various issues, I ended up with the decision to close it, but I am glad to meet you guys again with a fresh new blog that hosted on GitHub pages and Heroku. Before I dive into deep, I am starting with a post about how I created, and why it might be interesting to you.

Found my previous blogs snapshot from a website called [web archive](http://web.archive.org) which is a kind of time machine on the internet which give an opportunity to see the previous version of websites.

Many of you already know, or some of you already have started using GitHub pages which gives us an opportunity to host a static website for free. For those people who new for GitHub pages, I will try to explain here briefly.




Working on it ...
