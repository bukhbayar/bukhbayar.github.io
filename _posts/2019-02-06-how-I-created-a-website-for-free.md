First of all, it's great to meet you all since I closed my WordPress blog in 2011. Due to various issues, I ended up with the decision to close it, but I am glad to meet you guys again with a fresh new blog that hosted on GitHub pages and Heroku. Before I dive into deep, I am starting with a post about how I created, and why it might be interesting to you.

Found my previous blogs snapshot from a website called [Web Archive](http://web.archive.org) which is a kind of time machine on the internet which give an opportunity to see the previous version of websites.

Many of you already know, or some of you already have started using GitHub pages which gives us an opportunity to host a static website for free. For those people who new for GitHub pages, I will try to explain here briefly.  

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a service which was launched in 2008 (I didn't even notice it at that time) which hosts static web pages for free on Github. It allows us to create only one web page per users. Its often used for blogs, project documentation or any web page that you want. The pages are generated by static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) which is using HTML, Markdown files inside of the git repository.

Its designed for static web pages, but many developers have different approaches to contain dynamic contents using Heroku, AWS Lambda and even some developers deployed React application.
