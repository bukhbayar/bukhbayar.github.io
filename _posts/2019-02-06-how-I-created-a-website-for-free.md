First of all, it's great to meet you all since I closed my WordPress blog in 2011. Due to various issues, I ended up with the decision to close it, but I am glad to meet you guys again with a fresh new blog that hosted on GitHub pages and Heroku. Before I dive into deep, I am starting with a post about how I created, and why it might be interesting to you.

Found my previous blogs snapshot from a website called [Web Archive](http://web.archive.org) which is a kind of time machine on the internet which give an opportunity to see the previous version of websites.

Many of you already know, or some of you already have started using GitHub pages which gives us an opportunity to host a static website for free. For those people who new for GitHub pages, I will try to explain here briefly.  

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is s static site hosting service which was launched in 2008 (I didn't even notice it at that time) which hosts static web pages for free on Github. It allows us to create only one web page per users. Its often used for blogs, project documentation or any web page that you want. The pages are generated by static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) which is using HTML, Markdown files inside of the git repository. Its designed for static web pages, but many developers have different approaches to contain dynamic contents using Heroku, AWS Lambda and even some developers deployed [React applications](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/how-to-deploy-your-react-application-to-github-pages-in-less-than-5-minutes-8c5f665a2d2a).

If you are thinking to create your web page on Github pages, it will easy for you, but keep in mind that you have some limitation you should be aware.   

Here is the list of some limits on [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/):
- GitHub Pages source repositories have a recommended limit of 1GB .
- Published GitHub Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB.
- GitHub Pages sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100GB per month.
- GitHub Pages sites have a soft limit of 10 builds per hour.

Its is static web pages but still people trying to create some dynamic contents. As far as I can see, AWS Serverless might be easy to handle if you wanted to build some dynamic contents. [Here](https://medium.com/the-everyday-developer/how-i-update-dynamic-content-on-github-pages-with-aws-lambda-ddb70e9739c7) is the example of how Lambda function used to create dynamic contents in Github pages. However, I used [heroku](http://heroku.com) because its free in some cases.
